The name is kamal (which is short for kamal kumar or kamal kashyap, depending on where you know me from). I am a 18-year-old North Indian with a tech sort of background and a lot to say about the trends and direction of the scientific world.

I'm very dedicated to learn new things and to truly belive that you should never stop learning. I enjoy creating different things, whether that be websites, application or even non technical stuff like paintings and sketches.

Feel free to reach out if you have anything to talk about, you can mail me on  iamkamalkumar@proton.me .
